In the "Workspace Changes" window, add a descriptive version name and description to document the changes you made.
Click on **Publish** to publish the container changes.
Once published, you'll need to implement the Google Tag Manager code on your website. Copy the provided container snippet.

## Implementation of Google Tag Manager Code on Your Website

![Code snippet Image](/img/code_snippet.png)

- Copy the code from the GTM container snippet and paste it into the HTML file of your website that requires tracking.
- Assign the appropriate values to the variables you have created in the variables section, and specify the desired events within the triggers you have created.

```
 <script>
      window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
      window.dataLayer.push({
        event: "authorInfo",
        author: "Prasanna Jaganathan",
        article_title: "Artificial Intelligence",
        id: "article-1",
        date_published: "2020-06-01",
        category: "AI",
        author_id: 100
      });
</script>
<script>
      (function (w, d, s, l, i) {
        w[l] = w[l] || [];
        w[l].push({ "gtm.start": new Date().getTime(), event: "gtm.js" });
        var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
          j = d.createElement(s),
          dl = l != "dataLayer" ? "&l=" + l : "";
        j.async = true;
        j.src = "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=" + i + dl;
        f.parentNode.insertBefore(j, f);
      })(window, document, "script", "dataLayer", "GTM-5RD3FNQ");
</script>

```
- Save the changes made to your website's code. If your website uses a version control system, commit the changes. Publish the updated website code to make it live.
- Verify the implementation: Once the changes are live, it's crucial to verify if Google Tag Manager is working correctly on your website.Follow these steps:
    - Open your website in a browser.
    - Install the Google Tag Assistant Chrome extension (if not already installed).
    - Visit a few pages of your website and observe the tag assistant icon in the Chrome toolbar.
    - Click on the tag assistant icon to open the extension. It will display a summary of the tags fired on the current page.
