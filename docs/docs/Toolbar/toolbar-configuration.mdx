## Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a tag management system provided by Google. It simplifies the process of managing and deploying various tracking codes, scripts, and tags on a website or mobile app. With GTM, you can centrally manage and control all your marketing and analytics tags without directly modifying your website's code.
