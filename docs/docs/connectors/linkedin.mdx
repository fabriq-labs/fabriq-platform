# LinkedIn Page

To set up the LinkedIn source connector, please follow the instructions outlined below:

## Authentication

The connector currently uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Follow these steps:

#### Creating the Refresh Token:

LinkedIn Pages can use the client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token for OAuth 2.0 authentication in the UI connector's settings to make API requests. Refresh tokens expire 12 months from their creation date (365 days).

1. Log in to **LinkedIn** as the API user.

2. Create an App:
   - App Name: fabirq-source
   - Company: Search and find your LinkedIn Company Page.
   - Privacy policy URL: Link to the company's privacy policy.
   - Business email: Developer/admin email address.
   - App logo: Company's logo.
   - Review/agree to legal terms and create the app.

3. Review the Auth tab:
   - Save your **client_id** and **client_secret** for later steps.
   - OAuth 2.0 settings: Provide a **redirect_uri**.

4. Verify App:
   - In the Settings tab of your app dashboard, you'll see a Verify button. Click that button.
   - Generate and provide the verification URL to your Company's LinkedIn Admin to verify the app.

5. Request API Access:
   - Navigate to the Products tab.
   - Select the **Advertising API** and agree to the legal terms.
   - After a few minutes, refresh the page to see a link to View access form in place of the Select button.
   - Fill out the access form, and access should be granted within 72 hours.

6. Create a Refresh Token:
   - Navigate to the LinkedIn Developers' OAuth Token Tools and click Create token.
   - Select your newly created app and check the boxes for the following scopes:
     - r_organization_social
     - rw_organization_admin
   - Click Request access token, and once generated, save your Refresh token.

7. Use the **client_id**, **client_secret**, and **refresh_token** from Steps 2 and 6 to authorize the LinkedIn Pages connector within the Fabriq UI.

Once you have the details, update them in the Fabriq UI and click the **Save** button.
