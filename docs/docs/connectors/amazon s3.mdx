# Amazon S3
Setting up the S3 source connector involves creating a read-only S3 user and configuring the S3 connector through the Fabriq UI.

## Prerequisites

This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the Amazon S3 source connector.

| Feature | Available  |
|----------|----------|
| Full Refresh Sync    | Yes   |
| Incremental Sync    | yes  |
| Replicate Incremental Deletes    | No   |
| Namespaces    | No  |

## Path Patterns

This connector can sync multiple files by using glob-style patterns, rather than requiring a specific path for every file. This enables:

- Referencing many files with just one pattern, e.g. ** would indicate every file in the bucket.
- Referencing future files that don't exist yet (and therefore don't have a specific path).

You must provide a path pattern. You can also provide many patterns split with | for more complex directory layouts.

Each path pattern is a reference from the root of the bucket, so don't include the bucket name in the pattern(s).

Some example patterns:

- ** : match everything.
- **/*.csv : match all files with specific extension.
- myFolder/**/*.csv : match all csv files anywhere under myFolder.
- */** : match everything at least one folder deep.
- **/prefix*.csv : match all csv files with specific prefix.
- **/prefix*.parquet : match all parquet files with specific prefix.
- Let's look at a specific example, matching the following bucket layout:

## Connect

![S3 Image](/img/s3_connect.png)

- **File Name** - Pick a name to help you identify this source in Fabriq.
- **Bucket URL** - Name of the S3 bucket where the file(s) exist.
- **Bucket Region** - Region of the S3 bucket account exist.
- **Access Key Id** - In order to access private Buckets stored on AWS S3, this connector requires credentials with the proper permissions.
- **Secret Access Key** - In order to access private Buckets stored on AWS S3, this connector requires credentials with the proper permissions.
- **Path Prefix** - By providing a path-like prefix (e.g. myFolder/thisTable/) under which all the relevant files sit, we can optimize finding these in S3. This is optional but recommended if your bucket contains many folders/files which you don't need to replicate.
- **File Format**
- **Unique Key** - Unique key id in your csv file which help us to get the data.
